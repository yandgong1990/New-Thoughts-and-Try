Large single- cell datasets are now being routinely collected to catalogue the distribution and differentiation of cell states in both embryonic and adult tissues, aswell as in disease. Recent examples encompassing entire organ systems include the haematopoietic system28,29,
lung30,31, kidney32,33, heart34, gut endoderm35, somitic mesoderm36, nervous system37 and neural crest38. Additionally, whole- organism datasets have been generated for Caenorhabditis elegans39,40, Nematostella
vectensis41, Hydra42, annelids43 and planarians44–46. Furthermore, time series data for whole embryos have been mapped for zebrafish47,48, Xenopus laevis49, mouse50,51, Drosophila melanogaster52 and ascidians53

现在已经有了多物种，多器官甚至是时序的多物种的数据，我们能干些什么？
