To then visualize state manifolds, several algorithms are used that attempt to preserve the structure of the original cell graph when it is plotted in just two or three
dimensions (such as uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP)54, SPRING55 and ForceAtlas2 (ref.56)). Two- dimensional representations are popular and do capture meaningful biological trends. However,
they can be misleading, as they distort high- dimensional structures upon ‘flattening’ them, and in some cases algorithms force tree- like visual layouts that may further distort the original structure4

为了可视化数据的manifold，我们使用了维度消减，他们在一定程度上保护了数据的局部结构，给我们带来了有用的生物学信息，但是同时也丢弃了部分数据使我们可能对于生物学现象产生误解。
